title: "The Heat Pump Mandate: Who actually profits?"
---

The energy transition is often discussed in terms of carbon emissions. At *The Climate Ledger*, we look at it in terms of order books and margin expansion.

If the US moves toward a federal mandate or increased subsidies for heat pumps in 2026, the narrative shifts from "environmental necessity" to "industrial deployment." Here is where the smart money is looking.

### 1. The Pure Plays (HVAC Giants)
The obvious beneficiaries are the manufacturers with established supply chains.
* **Carrier Global (CARR):** They have pivoted aggressively toward electric solutions. A mandate effectively acts as a government-backed sales channel for their premium units.
* **Daikin Industries:** The Japanese giant has massive penetration in global markets and is scaling US manufacturing.

### 2. The "Pick and Shovel" Play: Copper
You cannot install millions of heat pumps without millions of tons of copper piping and wiring.
* Heat pumps require significantly more copper than traditional gas furnaces.
* This creates a supply squeeze for copper miners like **Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)**. The commodity price itself may be the best way to play this trend, bypassing the execution risk of individual manufacturers.

### 3. The Losers: Local Gas Distribution
The "short" side of this trade is local gas utilities. If heat pump adoption hits a tipping point, the "death spiral" for residential gas infrastructure accelerates—fewer customers paying to maintain the same aging pipe network raises costs for everyone left behind.

### The Bottom Line
Don't just watch the policy headlines. Watch the raw material orders. When Carrier starts locking in long-term copper contracts, the mandate is already priced in.
