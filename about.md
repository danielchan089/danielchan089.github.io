### The Mission

**The Climate Ledger** is a market intelligence resource dedicated to tracking the financial winners and losers of the global energy transition.

While mainstream media focuses on the politics or the science of climate change, we focus on the **capital allocation**. We believe that decarbonization is the single largest re-pricing of assets in history.

We track:
* **Regulatory Tailwinds:** How policy shifts (like the IRA or EU Green Deal) alter profit margins.
* **Commodity Cycles:** The raw materials (Copper, Lithium, Nickel) required to build the new economy.
* **Tech Deployment:** Moving beyond "hype" cycles to identify companies with actual unit economics.

### The Author

**Daniel Chan** is an analyst focused on the intersection of emerging markets, industrial strategy, and climate finance.
